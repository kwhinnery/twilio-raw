# Twilio Demo

This is a demo app showing a few examples of how to use the Twilio module in a simple node program.

To run this app, provide either environment variables for your Twilio credentials called `ACCOUNT_SID` and `AUTH_TOKEN`,
or provide a file `config.js` with the information provided in the sample config file at the project root.
